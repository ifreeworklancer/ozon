                        <p class="faq-page-item__description">
                            There are several reasons why you should get your air duct system cleaned:
                            1. Improving indoor air quality is one of the most common and important reasons for
                            cleaning your air ducts. This will reduce allergies and decrease breathing problems for
                            people with respiratory health conditions.
                            2. Build-up of dust in the system can restrict airflow causing it to work harder and take
                            more time to heat or cool your house, thus spending more energy and your money.
                            3. Dirt and debris that circulate in the system can get to the main components of the
                            furnace, including the evaporator coil and blower, reducing lifespan of the system.

                        <p class="faq-page-item__description">
                            Source removal method is the most effective way to clean your air duct system. This method
                            entails putting the system under the negative pressure by connecting powerful HEPA vacuum
                            to the main trunk line and sealing the vents to direct the pressure to desired point. Then
                            by using different tools like Agitator and brushes, all the dust and debris are dislodged
                            from the interior vent surfaces and pushed towards the vacuum, so they can be safely
                            removed from your home.
